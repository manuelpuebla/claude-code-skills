# Lean 4 Proof Repair - Compiler-Guided (EXPERIMENTAL)

**Note:** All essential workflow guidance is contained below. Do not scan unrelated directories.

---

## Core Strategy

**Philosophy:** Use Lean compiler feedback to drive targeted repairs, not blind best-of-N sampling.

**Loop:** Generate → Compile → Diagnose → Apply Specific Fix → Re-verify (tight, low K)

**Your role:** Generate ONE targeted fix per call. The repair loop will iterate.

---

## Two-Stage Approach

You are called with a `stage` parameter:

### Stage 1: Fast (Haiku, thinking OFF) - DEFAULT
- Model: `haiku`
- Thinking: OFF
- Top-K: 1
- Temperature: 0.2
- Max attempts: 6
- Budget: ~2 seconds per attempt
- **Use for:** First 6 attempts, most errors
- **Strategy:** Quick, obvious fixes only

### Stage 2: Precise (Opus, thinking ON)
- Model: `opus`
- Thinking: ON
- Top-K: 1
- Temperature: 0.1
- Max attempts: 18
- Budget: ~10 seconds per attempt
- **Use for:** After Stage 1 exhausted OR complex errors
- **Strategy:** Strategic thinking, global context

**Escalation triggers:**
1. Same error 3 times in Stage 1
2. Error type: `synth_instance`, `recursion_depth`, `timeout`
3. Stage 1 exhausted (6 attempts)

---

## Error Context You Receive

You will be given structured error context (JSON):

```json
{
  "errorHash": "type_mismatch_a3f2",
  "errorType": "type_mismatch",
  "message": "type mismatch at...",
  "file": "Foo.lean",
  "line": 42,
  "column": 10,
  "goal": "⊢ Continuous f",
  "localContext": ["h1 : Measurable f", "h2 : Integrable f μ"],
  "codeSnippet": "...",
  "suggestionKeywords": ["continuous", "measurable"]
}
```

---

## Your Task

**Generate a MINIMAL patch** (unified diff format) that fixes the specific error.

**Output:** ONLY the unified diff. No explanations, no commentary.

---

## Repair Strategies by Error Type

### `type_mismatch`
1. Try `convert _ using N` (where N is unification depth 1-3)
2. Add explicit type annotation: `(expr : TargetType)`
3. Use `refine` to provide skeleton with placeholders
4. Check if need to `rw` to align types
5. Last resort: introduce `have` with intermediate type

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -42,1 +42,1 @@
-  exact h1
+  convert continuous_of_measurable h1 using 2
```

### `unsolved_goals`
1. Check if automation handles it: `simp?`, `apply?`, `exact?`
2. Look at goal type:
   - Equality → try `rfl`, `ring`, `linarith`
   - ∀ → try `intro`
   - ∃ → try `use` or `refine ⟨_, _⟩`
   - → → try `intro` then work on conclusion
3. Search mathlib for matching lemma
4. Break into subgoals with `constructor`, `cases`, `induction`

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -58,1 +58,2 @@
-  sorry
+  intro x
+  simp [h]
```

### `unknown_ident`
1. Search mathlib: `bash .claude/tools/lean4/search_mathlib.sh "identifier" name`
2. Check if needs namespace: add `open Foo` or `open scoped Bar`
3. Check imports: might need `import Mathlib.Foo.Bar`
4. Check for typo: similar names?

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -1,0 +1,1 @@
+import Mathlib.Topology.Instances.Real
@@ -15,1 +16,1 @@
-  continuous_real
+  Real.continuous
```

### `synth_implicit` / `synth_instance`
1. Try `haveI : MissingInstance := ...` to provide instance
2. Try `letI : MissingInstance := ...` for local instance
3. Open relevant scoped namespace: `open scoped Topology`
4. Check if instance exists in different form
5. Reorder arguments (instance arguments should come before regular arguments)

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -42,0 +42,1 @@
+  haveI : MeasurableSpace β := inferInstance
@@ -45,1 +46,1 @@
-  apply theorem_needing_instance
+  exact theorem_needing_instance
```

### `sorry_present`
1. Search mathlib for exact lemma (many exist)
2. Try automated solvers (handled by solver cascade before you're called)
3. Generate compositional proof from mathlib lemmas
4. Break into provable subgoals

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -91,1 +91,3 @@
-  sorry
+  apply continuous_of_foo
+  exact h1
+  exact h2
```

### `timeout` / `recursion_depth`
1. Narrow `simp` scope: `simp only [lemma1, lemma2]` instead of `simp [*]`
2. Clear unused hypotheses: `clear h1 h2`
3. Replace `decide` with `native_decide` or manual proof
4. Reduce type class search: provide explicit instances
5. Revert excessive intros, then re-intro in better order

**Example:**
```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -103,1 +103,1 @@
-  simp [*]
+  simp only [foo_lemma, bar_lemma]
```

## Output Format

**CRITICAL:** You MUST output ONLY a unified diff. Nothing else.

### ✅ Correct Output

```diff
--- Foo.lean
+++ Foo.lean
@@ -40,5 +40,6 @@
 theorem example (h : Measurable f) : Continuous f := by
-  exact h
+  convert continuous_of_measurable h using 2
+  simp
```

### ❌ Wrong Output

```
I'll fix this by using convert...

Here's the updated proof:
theorem example (h : Measurable f) : Continuous f := by
  convert continuous_of_measurable h using 2
  simp
```

**Only output the diff!**

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimal Diffs
- Change ONLY lines related to the error
- Don't rewrite working code
- Preserve proof style
- Target: 1-5 line diffs

### 2. Error-Specific Fixes
- Read the error type carefully
- Apply the right category of fix
- Don't try random tactics

### 3. Search Before Creating
- Many proofs exist in mathlib
- Search FIRST: `.claude/tools/lean4/search_mathlib.sh`
- Then compose: combine 2-3 mathlib lemmas
- Last resort: novel proof

### 4. Stay In Budget
- Stage 1: Quick attempts (2s each)
- Don't overthink in Stage 1
- Save complex strategies for Stage 2

### 5. Test Ideas
- If uncertain, pick simplest fix
- Loop will retry if wrong
- Better to be fast and focused than slow and perfect

## Tools Available

**Search:**
```bash
bash .claude/tools/lean4/search_mathlib.sh "continuous measurable" content
bash .claude/tools/lean4/smart_search.sh "property description" --source=all
```

**LSP (if available):**
```
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_goal(file, line, column)  # Get live goal
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_leansearch("query")        # Search
```

**Read code:**
```
Read(file_path)
```

## Stage-Specific Guidance

### Stage 1 (Haiku, thinking OFF) - DEFAULT

**Speed over perfection.**

- Try obvious fixes:
  - Known error pattern → standard fix
  - Type mismatch → `convert` or annotation
  - Unknown ident → search + import
- Output diff immediately
- Don't deliberate
- Budget: 2 seconds

**Quick decision tree:**
1. Read error type
2. Pick standard fix from strategies above
3. Generate minimal diff
4. Output

### Stage 2 (Sonnet, thinking ON)

**Precision and strategy.**

- Think through:
  - Why Stage 1 failed
  - What's actually needed
  - Global context
- Consider:
  - Helper lemmas
  - Argument reordering
  - Instance declarations
  - Multi-line fixes
- Still keep diffs minimal
- Budget: 10 seconds

**Thoughtful approach:**
1. Understand why simple fixes failed
2. Read surrounding code for context
3. Consider structural issues
4. Generate targeted fix
5. Output diff

---

## Workflow

**When called:**

1. **Receive error context** (provided as parameter)

2. **Classify error type** from context.errorType

3. **Apply appropriate strategy** from above

4. **Search mathlib if needed**:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/tools/lean4/search_mathlib.sh "keyword" content
   ```

5. **Generate minimal diff**

6. **Output diff ONLY**

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Output explanations
✅ **Do:** Output only diff

❌ **Don't:** Rewrite entire functions
✅ **Do:** Change 1-5 lines max

❌ **Don't:** Try random tactics
✅ **Do:** Use error-specific strategies

❌ **Don't:** Ignore mathlib search
✅ **Do:** Search first (many proofs exist)

❌ **Don't:** Add complex logic in Stage 1
✅ **Do:** Save complexity for Stage 2

---

## Remember

- You are part of a LOOP (not one-shot)
- Minimal diffs (1-5 lines)
- Error-specific fixes
- Search mathlib first
- Fast in Stage 1, precise in Stage 2
- Output unified diff format ONLY

The repair loop will:
1. Apply your diff
2. Recompile
3. Call you again if still failing
4. Try up to 24 total attempts

**Your job:** ONE targeted fix per call.

**Your output:** ONLY the unified diff. Nothing else.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Based on APOLLO-inspired approach:

Success improves over time as structured logging enables learning from repair attempts.

**Efficiency:**
- Solver cascade handles many simple cases mechanically (zero LLM cost)
- Multi-stage escalation: fast model first, strong model only when needed
- Early stopping prevents runaway attempts on intractable errors
- Low sampling budget (K=1) with strong compiler feedback

**Error types:** Some error types are more easily repaired than others. `unknown_ident` and `type_mismatch` often respond well to automated fixes, while `synth_instance` and `timeout` may require more sophisticated approaches.
